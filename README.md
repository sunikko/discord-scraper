# Web Scraper Example

This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to demonstrate web scraping skills. The scraper extracts product details, such as title, price, image URL, and product URL, from e-commerce websites like Amazon (used as a sample). It shows how to interact with a website, parse its content, and filter out unwanted results.

**Note:** The scraper is not specifically targeting Amazon, but rather itâ€™s an example of how to use web scraping techniques in Python. The Amazon UK page is used here for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Scrapes product information from an e-commerce website (Amazon UK in this case).
- Excludes sponsored products.
- Configured headers to prevent blocking by Amazon.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**
2. **Libraries**:
   - `beautifulsoup4`
   - `requests`

To install the necessary libraries, follow the steps below.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Setting Up the Virtual Environment and Installing Dependencies

To isolate dependencies, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

````bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment (you can replace 'scrap_env' with any name)
python3 -m venv scrap_env
source scrap_env/bin/activate

# Install Dependencies
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

# Run the Scraper
python scraper.py

````

## 2. Discord Integration

This project also integrates with Discord. To use the Discord bot functionality, follow the steps below:

### Create a Discord Bot:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application and add a bot.
3. Get the bot token from the "Bot" tab.

### Run the Discord Bot:

The bot listens for a specific message (`!scrape`) to scrape products and send them to your Discord channel.

The bot responds to `!scrape` by scraping product details from Amazon and sends the results as rich embeds to the Discord channel.
